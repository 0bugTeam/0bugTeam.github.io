## Description

Fake Boost

In the shadow of The Fray, a new test called ""Fake Boost"" whispers promises of free Discord Nitro perks. It's a trap, set in a world where nothing comes without a cost. As factions clash and alliances shift, the truth behind Fake Boost could be the key to survival or downfall. Will your faction see through the deception? KORPâ„¢ challenges you to discern reality from illusion in this cunning trial.

## Solution

From the downloadable file, we get a `pcapng` file which we can open using wireshark.

After filtering the traffic for only `http` we get two interesting requests.

One of it is a `GET` request to `/freediscordnitro` which seems to have some encoded data and viewing at the end of the requst looks like some script. We can confirm that it is a encoded or obfuscated powershell script from the header

```
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=discordnitro.ps1
```

After saving the contenet or data into a file. We can google for powershell deobfuscation tool. Among them the one i found that worked for me is https://github.com/Malandrone/PowerDecode

After decoding we can see many differne functins and variales, among it was a variable that is used only one time, which is during initialisation.

```ps1
$part1 = "SFRCe2ZyMzNfTjE3cjBHM25fM3hwMDUzZCFf"
```

Upon decoding the string with `base64` gives us part of the flag.

-----

The second part of th flag seems to be in the other `POST` request\
`/rj1893rj1joijdkajwda`, that we got in wireshark.

It also contains some kind of base64 encoded data

```

but one decoding, it gives us some gibrish, which means it's further **`"encrypted"`**, we can confirm and find it out the decoded powershell script.


While the script contains may other function and variables the main thing it watch are

```ps1
# The AES key and the function call to 'Encrypt-String'
$AES_KEY = "Y1dwaHJOVGs5d2dXWjkzdDE5amF5cW5sYUR1SWVGS2k="
$payload = $userInfos | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
$encryptedData = Encrypt-String -key $AES_KEY -plaintext $payload
```

and the other two functions


```ps1
function Encrypt-String($key, $plaintext) {
    $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($plaintext)
    $aesManaged = Create-AesManagedObject $key
    $encryptor = $aesManaged.CreateEncryptor()
    $encryptedData = $encryptor.TransformFinalBlock($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length);
    [byte[]] $fullData = $aesManaged.IV + $encryptedData
    [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($fullData)
}
```

```ps1
unction Create-AesManagedObject($key, $IV, $mode) {
    $aesManaged = New-Object "System.Security.Cryptography.AesManaged"

    if ($mode="CBC") { $aesManaged.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CBC }
    elseif ($mode="CFB") {$aesManaged.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CFB}
    elseif ($mode="CTS") {$aesManaged.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CTS}
    elseif ($mode="ECB") {$aesManaged.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::ECB}
    elseif ($mode="OFB"){$aesManaged.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::OFB}


    $aesManaged.Padding = [System.Security.Cryptography.PaddingMode]::PKCS7
    $aesManaged.BlockSize = 128
    $aesManaged.KeySize = 256
    if ($IV) {
        if ($IV.getType().Name -eq "String") {
            $aesManaged.IV = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($IV)
        }
        else {
            $aesManaged.IV = $IV
        }
    }
    if ($key) {
        if ($key.getType().Name -eq "String") {
            $aesManaged.Key = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($key)
        }
        else {
            $aesManaged.Key = $key
        }
    }
    $aesManaged
}
```

From this things we can learn that the AES key is used is used after decoding it form base64, the keysize being 256.

Now we can use a online aes decrption site liek https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption

We paste our base64 encrpted data, provide our decoded AES key, set the Key Size in Bits to 256 and select cipher mode as cbc.

One decrypting we get a decrypted base64 data, which one further decoding from base64 gives us teh following

```json
{ "ID":  "1212103240066535494", "Email":  "YjNXNHIzXzBmX1QwMF9nMDBkXzJfYjNfN3J1M18wZmYzcjV9", "GlobalName":  "phreaks_admin", "Token":  "MoIxtjEwMz20M5ArNjUzNTQ5NA.Gw3-GW.bGyEkOVlZCsfQ8-6FQnxc9sMa15h7UP3cCOFNk"}, {"ID":  "1212103240066535494", "Email":  "YjNXNHIzXzBmX1QwMF9nMDBkXzJfYjNfN3J1M18wZmYzcjV9",  "GlobalName":  "phreaks_admin",        "Token":  "MoIxtjEwMz20M5ArNjUzNTQ5NA.Gw3-GW.bGyEkOVlZCsfQ8-6FQnxc9sMa15h7UP3cCOFNk" }
```

It's in json but poorly formated. But if we take the string from the Email section and decode it we get the rest part of the flag and joining the part1 or first part of the flag gives us the main flag.
