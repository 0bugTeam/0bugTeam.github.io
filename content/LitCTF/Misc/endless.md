## Solution

The Challenge was really simple. The Flag was spelt out in the audio recording and can be easily decode to text using some online tools for converting audio to text service or software.

I used [veed.io](https://www.veed.io/) but there are other better alternative, mostly now living in the world of AI. Note, most of them might not be free and those that are free might not get u 100% accurate result. For me i got 60% sucess rest i manually fixed it myslef

i got something like :

```
The content of this flag is all lowercase except for the flag name littctf f zero udio four RTBsp six
```

But i fix it and got the following Flag

```
Flag : LITCTF{f0udao4rtbsp6}
```
